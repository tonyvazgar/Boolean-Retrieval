# Boolean-Retrieval

We have to implement the next tasks:

• To implement the Inverted index algorithm to process a boolean query.

• Using the intersection function of the Algorithm in page 11 of the book Information to IR (Manning).

• It will be tested with my own documents.

• To writea one page(max) document, describing the problem and more important “your thoughts” and conclusions.
